Aballister-Game
Proyecto for programming 2 that includes use of all topics seen in class. Is a 
rpg duegon game in cpp. Was programmed in 2019 and runs inside the console.

Getting started
Download cpp file and have a compiler for cpp 11 in order the execute the file. 
Once file is downloaded in order to run you will need to compile the cpp file and run the exacutable.
The game was made on windows system and not tested on other systems.

Running the test
When the exacutable is run it will open in the console. The programe uses keyborad inputs and certain game events are random so replacating some cases will be dificult.
Within the code their are global flag on the player progracion that can be motified to test certain cases 
ex: int piso = 0; /** El piso en el que se encuentra **/
